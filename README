draw.py:
	python3 draw.py file_with_numbers.txt result_file_with_graph.png
	drawing graph from numbers with floating point divided by newline
	first line zero-th number
	second line first number
	...
	...
	n-th line (n-1)-th number

kolmogorov_diff:
	python3 kolmogorov_diff.py first.txt second.txt result.png
	calculating kolmogorov difference between two files with numbers
	and ploting two curves in the same plot for comparison 

run.sh:
	run.sh mPhaseImitation.bin N_random_14bit_numbers test.csv
	mPhaseImitation.bin you can get by compiling this repository
		https://github.com/KimalIsaev/mPhaseImitation
	it generates 3 files:
		1) file with random numbers in rng_files\
		2) file with orbit time distribution in results\
		3) file with plot of orbit time distribution in pictures\
	test.csv file with multiple lines of parameters for queue system
		N_device X_flow X_orbit Q_R0 Q_R1 Q_phases X_phases
	N_devices: amount of devices in system
	X_flow: intensity of puasson flow. which generating input request
	X_orbit: intensity of one request in orbit
	Q_R0: probability to exit system after device executed request  
	Q_R0: probability to be executed again
		after device executed request already once
	Q_R2 = 1-(Q_R1+Q_R2):  probability to orbit 
		after device executed request
	Q_phases: multiple non-negative values, 
		sum of which must be equal to one,
		defines probability to use phase with same index
	X_phases: multiple positive values,
		defines intensity of phase with same index
