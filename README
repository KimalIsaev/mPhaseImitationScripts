warning:
	the main script (run.sh) working only with UNIX-like OSes
	scripts draw.py and kolmogorov_diff.py works everywhere,
	where python > 3.5 works

draw.py:
	python3 draw.py file_with_numbers.txt result_file_with_graph.png
	drawing graph from numbers with floating point divided by newline
	first line zero-th number
	second line first number
	...
	...
	n-th line (n-1)-th number

kolmogorov_diff:
	python3 kolmogorov_diff.py first.txt second.txt result.png
	calculating kolmogorov difference between two files with numbers
	and ploting two curves in the same plot for comparison 
	format of files same that used by draw.py

run.sh:
	run.sh mPhaseImitation.bin N_random_14bit_numbers test.csv
	mPhaseImitation.bin you can get by compiling this repository
		https://github.com/KimalIsaev/mPhaseImitation
	it generates 3 files:
		1) file with random numbers in rng_files\
		2) file with orbit time distribution in results\
		3) file with plot of orbit time distribution in pictures\
	test.csv file with multiple lines of parameters 
	for different queue system, one line is for one queue system
	and consist of this parameters in this order:
		N_device X_flow X_orbit Q_R0 Q_R1 Q_phases X_phases
	N_devices: amount of devices in system
	X_flow: intensity of puasson flow. which generating input request
	X_orbit: intensity of one request in orbit
	Q_R0: probability to exit system after device executed request  
	Q_R0: probability to be executed again
		after device executed request already 
	Q_R2 = 1-(Q_R1+Q_R2):  probability to orbit 
		after device executed request
	Q_phases: multiple non-negative values, 
		sum of which must be equal to one,
		defines probability to use phase with same index
	X_phases: multiple positive values
		(same number of values as Q-phases had),
		defines intensity of phase with same index

my standart use of this scripts:
	./run.sh ./mPhaseImitation.exe 2000 tests/first.csv
	xv pictures/outputed_file.png
